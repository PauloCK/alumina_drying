<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Mathematical models are widely used in the design, control, and optimization of systems. With the growing popularization of the computer as an accessible tool and technology advances, it is increasingly common to include computer simulation as a fundamental step in the development of chemical processes. The high energy demands in the drying process lead to stricter requirements regarding the efficiency of the equipment used. In order  to improve drying efficiency, the DEQ/UFSCar Particulate Systems developed a thick fixed bed primarily intended to verify process models. The cell allows changing the direction of the airflow, causing the decrease of the temperature and moisture gradients inside the bed. Were then derived and experimentally verified dynamic models with different degrees of complexity, and recently, a two-phase model was implemented in Matlab that describes with a good agreement the drying of alumina in the  thick fixed bed. Because the alumina has essentially free water (easier drying) and is structurally simple, it was the standard grain used in drying simulations with airflow reversal. The present Final Undergraduate Paper  aims to simulate the drying of thick fixed bed alumina with airflow reversal using the two phases model, converting the Matlab script into Scilab and Python. The simulation results were  compared to the conventional fixed bed operation to see if it effectively reduced the temperature and moisture gradients achieved with the reversal technique.
